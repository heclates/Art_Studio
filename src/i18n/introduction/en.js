  aboutText: `
      Our art studio, founded in 2022 in Prague 9, is a space where everyone, regardless of age and experience, can immerse themselves in the world of art and creativity. Here, children take their first steps in drawing, and adults find moments of peace and inspiration amidst the everyday hustle.

      <br><br>
      We believe that art should be accessible to everyone — from children who are just beginning to discover the joy of creativity, to adults seeking new ways for self-expression. Every class in our studio is more than just learning. It's an opportunity to unlock your creative potential, feel supported, and experience joy from the process of creation itself.
      <br><br>
      Join us to find inspiration in creativity and make it a part of your daily life.
